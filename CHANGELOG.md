# Initial Commit - December 17th, 2025:

This is just the initial commit i'm making for the Boundary Connectivity Project (cooler name in the future I promise)
At a high level my goal is to first make a working version of Boundary (HCP) connecting to Terraform, Nomad, Vault, and other systems. Ideally Terraform and Vault first for the time being. I'll be doing this in my own personal environments to avoid any restrictions imposed by doormat (ily doormat)
