# Project Overview

The 'Boundary Connectivity Project' is a proof of concept to showcase Boundary's inherent capabilities with regards to: 

1. Single Sign On Access to various HashiCorp components
2. Team Workflow Standardization (HashiCorp Products at Scale)
3. Seamless access without Firewall Configuration, Private Network re-architecting or exposure, and credential management. 

The main focus of this POC is to showcase Boundary acting as a connector to multiple HashiCorp tools such as Terraform, Vault, Nomad, Packer etc.
